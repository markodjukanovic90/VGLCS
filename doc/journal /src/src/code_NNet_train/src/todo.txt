1. Adapt the Node class: add the atribute vector<int> features
2. Write a function to derive features from each node 
3. nnet.cpp has to be part of it double BS(double t_lim, int beta, Instance* inst, MLP& neural_network, bool training)  
   as it provides an outcome based on the extracted features 
4. Think about the set of reliable features that can learn how promising are subproblems in the search 
   scale out-of-distribution 
   5. Work on Beam_search.cpp and Node.cpp and Node.h
