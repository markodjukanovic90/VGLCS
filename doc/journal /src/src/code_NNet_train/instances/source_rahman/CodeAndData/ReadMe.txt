 Source Codes are available in the "src" folder.

 Data sets used in the experiments are available in "Data" folder.

 In "Data" folder, there are 6 subfolders containing real and random datasets for the 3 problems under  consideration. 
 
 data_SeqIc contains 100_input.txt which contains 100 inputs.
  
 The other datafiles starts with the 1st letter of protein family. For example
 p12.txt contains Protease datasets. 

 The random data files are named by SeqNoPatternNo_serialNo.txt. For example d22_0.txt
 stands for 2 seq, 2 constraints. There are 10 cases for each set, numbered from 0 to 9.

 Run the file Browse.java. A GUI will appear.
 
 You will see 6 options--
   "Seq-Ic-LCS FA",
   "Seq-Ic-LCS CC", 
   "Seq-Ec-LCS FA", 
		          
   "Seq-Ec-LCS ZG", 
   "Str-Ec-LCS FA", 
   "Str-Ec-LCS HYA" 

  FA = Finite Automata , ZG, HYA, CC stands for DP algorithms mk
  provided by respective authors.

  Select a data file with file browser and select the algorithm. You will see the outputs.

  Note: In the current version, the arraysizes in the source codes are specified with maximum possible values. But  this is not required at every case. The results are generated by adjusting the arraysize so the output time         is the best.
