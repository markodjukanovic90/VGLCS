This repository consists of the implementation of a Beam Search (BS) guided by a Neural Network for solving the Restricted Longest Common Subsequence (RLCS) problem.

The neural network acts as the guidance heuristic for the BS. It is trained using a Random Key Genetic Algorithm (RKGA), in which each individual represents a set of weights
