To train the
(feed-forward) neural network (NN) of the LBS approach, we employed
𝛽 = 100 during training for the benchmark set Random. For benchmark
set Abstract, we employed 𝛽 = 200, which seemed to perform better.
Remember that this is the value of the beam width used for calculating
the training and validation values during the execution of the training
BRKGA. The parameters of this BRKGA were set to the following default
values: 𝑝size = 20, 𝑝e = 1, 𝑝m = 7 and 𝜌 = 0.5.
